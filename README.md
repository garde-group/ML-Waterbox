# ML-Waterbox
See the (IN PROGESS) README.pdf for full information on this repository (as of May 2019).

In short, this repository contains the code (and other writings of relevance) done by the Garde Group with the goal of applying ML/Deep Learning to the analysis of water simulations. Please contact us (lockwo@rpi.edu) before using any of this code. Yes I do know the organization is bad, but [understanding it](https://kriscroes.github.io/images/blog1/dilbert.pn) [therefore makes me] (https://xkcd.com/1597/) [essential.](https://xkcd.com/1296/)
