# ML-Waterbox
See the (IN PROGESS) README.pdf for full information on this repository (as of May 2019).

Waterbot is where all of the current work is going on. It's expanding upon the project but mostly starting from the beginning again to ensure the validity of the results.

In short, this repository contains the code (and other writings of relevance) done by the Garde Group with the goal of applying ML/Deep Learning to the analysis of water simulations. Please contact us (lockwo@rpi.edu) before using any of this code. Yes I do know the organization of this repo is bad, but [understanding it](https://kriscroes.github.io/images/blog1/dilbert.png) [therefore makes me](https://xkcd.com/1597/) [essential.](https://xkcd.com/1296/)
