# Analysis of Molecular Simulations with Machine Learning

In short, this repository contains the code (and other writings of relevance) done by the Garde Group with the goal of applying ML/Deep Learning to the analysis of water simulations. Please contact us (lockwo@rpi.edu) before using any of this code. The most recent work is in the Waterbot folder. Benchmarking contains timing tests, and source code contains work done previously. 

Outcomes of this Project:

-[Final Report](https://github.com/garde-group/ML-Waterbox/blob/master/water_final.pdf)
